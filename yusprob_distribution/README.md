e.g:
ML Models can assume how your data is structured.

Now that you have some data in hand it is a good best practice to check that your data is in line with 
the underlying assumptions of your chosen machine learning model.

With this statistical tools, you can calculate things like the mean, inner-quartile range (IQR), and standard deviation. 
These tools can give you insight into the scope, scale, and shape of the dataset.
